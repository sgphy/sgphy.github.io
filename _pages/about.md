Hello! I am Saptam. Let me take you through the bits, which I think you might find interesting and relevant.

I am presently working at [Qorvo Inc.](https://www.qorvo.com/) as a [Sr. Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saptamg/) in the BAW R&D. Qorvo leads the communication technology market, providing [BAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_bulk_acoustic_resonator)/[SAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_acoustic_wave) based filters/PAs (power amplifiers) operating in the telecommunication frequencies. At the heart of these filters are individual resonators made from thin film stacks consisting of Bragg reflectors, electrodes and piezoelectric layers. On a day to day basis, I deal with designing experiments (DOE) for characterizing these constituent thin films and the devices, to optimize/improve device performance, yield improvement etc. At the same time, a part of my job also involves electro-acoustic simulations (finite element analysis) of BAW resonators using COMSOL Multiphysics for predicting device performances, identifying scattering sources, optimizing geometries etc. In both aspects, statistical data analysis is required. 


Long story short
======
Although I got trained as an engineer, my most comfortable corner to dwell is condensed matter/solid state physics. Specifically studying physical properties and phenomenon emerging from specific arrangement of atoms and crystals, which can sometimes occur naturally like multiferroicity in \( \mathrm{BiFeO_{3}} \) (it is ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic at room temperature) and sometimes engineered like polar vortices in twisted bilayer \( \mathrm{BaTiO_{3}} \). Not surprisingly, all of these are not independent but come associated with a plethora of other interesting aspects such as phase transitions, domain walls, avalanches to name a few.
Besides the physics of materials, I am very keen on the instrumentation required to study these properties particularly X-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy among others.

My introduction to materials' physics in the lab happened with an internship at the [NGPR lab](https://www.ngprlab.com/) in my university at Ranchi. My first project was to fabricate and characterize an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell with PEDOT:PSS and P3HT-PCBM on an ITO substrate. I must admit that the first devices I made with the help of my mentor (a PhD student in the lab), were barely producing any power. No surprises there, however the next ones worked. Nevertheless, from there on I got into experimental physics. A year later, I moved to [NCL](https://www.ncl-india.org/), Pune as a research intern at the [Thin Film Optoelectronics](http://academic.ncl.res.in/ak.rath/home) group. I wrote my Master's thesis on [quantum dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) (QD) solar cells, particularly about the role of surface passivation in reducing the defect density in the QDs and its implication on device performance. I developed my expertise both on fabrication and optoelectronic characterization of semciconductor devices such as Impedance spectroscopy, photocurrent spectroscopy, quantum efficiency measurements etc. All on home built setups.

By the time I was graduating, I was offered a Marie-Curie fellowship ([PREBIST](https://bist.eu/education/prebist/prebist-fellows/)) for pursing a PhD, at the [Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)](https://icn2.cat/en/) in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. While my initial focus was on halide perovskite based optoelectronic devices, I was driven to study oxide phyics, particularly multiferroics. I wrote my doctoral thesis advised by [Prof. Gustau Catalan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=74q4GjoAAAAJ&hl=en). I was co-advised by [Dr. David Pesquera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=veKFcyAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Gabriele De Luca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ah90rggAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). In my thesis, I ended up exploring light-matter interaction on oxides (ferroics and strongly correlated systems). While the group's expertise was on the materials' physics part, I was happy to have added the taste of optics with it.

Besides work

I love hiking, although now I have compromised that for a long lost love, reading. However, I did hike consistently in the 2500- 3500 metres ranges, every once in a while going higher than that. Two of the emblematic peaks I climbed were Pico Aneto (3404 m) and Pica d'Estats (3143 m), among others. 

I recently read 'Critical mass' by Phillip Ball. It was scientific treat but did not get a lot of the old Gregorian/English references. Now I am back to reading 'Nexus' by Yuval Noah Harari.

I am deeply interested in socio-politics, but unfortunately don't understand well an important chunk of it, the economics. As you might guess, very often I find myself indulged in heated debates.
